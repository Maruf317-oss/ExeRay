## Features üåü

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost for accurate detection.
- **Rapid Classification**: Quickly analyzes files to provide immediate feedback on their safety.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Examines entropy, imports, and metadata to identify malicious patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with ExeRay, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maruf317-oss/ExeRay.git
   cd ExeRay
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run ExeRay**:
   After installation, you can run ExeRay with the following command:
   ```bash
   python exe_ray.py [path_to_executable]
   ```

## Usage üìä

To use ExeRay, you need to provide the path to the Windows executable you want to analyze. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```bash
python exe_ray.py example.exe
```

ExeRay will then process the file and output whether it is benign or malicious based on its analysis.

## How It Works üîç

ExeRay uses machine learning techniques to classify executables. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the process:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Entropy**: Measures the randomness of the file, which can indicate obfuscation.
   - **Imports**: Analyzes the libraries and functions the executable uses.
   - **Metadata**: Reviews the file's metadata for suspicious attributes.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The tool is trained using a dataset of known benign and malicious executables.
   - It employs algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost for classification.

3. **Classification**:
   - When a new executable is analyzed, ExeRay extracts its features and feeds them into the trained model.
   - The model outputs a classification result, indicating whether the file is likely safe or malicious.
